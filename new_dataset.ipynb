I thought it was a lost cause, but I found this little market and it did not disappoint...for the most part. The staff was friendly and made my sushi to order. It was pretty fresh (am I really in a corner market ordering sushi?) and came out quickly. They have a nice selection of bottled juices, so I also picked up a gingery apple cider vinegar concoction that was refreshing. \n",

I couldn't even eat dinner that night. It's my own fault for allowing myself a cheat meal and not looking closely at the packaging, but honestly why is there wheat in your soy sauce? I checked other brands and found nothing, so it must be a filler?\n",
